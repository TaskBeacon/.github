# TaskBeacon

Welcome to **TaskBeacon**, a community-driven platform for sharing, standardizing, and enhancing psychological paradigms.  
Our mission is to improve **reproducibility and efficiency** in psychological and brain science research through structured formats and LLM-powered experiment generation.

TaskBeacon is an open science initiative that offers a suite of tools and resources:

- [TAPS](https://taskbeacon.github.io/taps) – A standardized format for structuring cognitive tasks  
- [psyflow](https://taskbeacon.github.io/psyflow/) – A Python library for programming cognitive experiments  
- [Task Library](https://taskbeacon.github.io/task-registry/) – A curated collection of well-documented experimental templates  

TaskBeacon also provides features that enhance reusability, localization, and collaboration:
- [Text-to-voice](https://taskbeacon.github.io/text2voice) – Automatically generate voice instructions from translated text for consistent and accessible delivery  
- [Localization](https://taskbeacon.github.io/localization) – Enables cross-cultural localization by separating text components from task logic  
- [LLMs](https://taskbeacon.github.io/LLMs) – Leverage Large Language Models to assist with task documentation and localization  
- [Track variants](https://taskbeacon.github.io/versioning) – Manage task variants using GitHub branches
