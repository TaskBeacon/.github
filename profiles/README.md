# 🌟 TaskBeacon – Advancing Reproducible Psychological Paradigms  

Welcome to **TaskBeacon**, a community-driven platform dedicated to **sharing, standardizing, and enhancing psychological paradigms**. Our mission is to improve **reproducibility and efficiency in psychological and brain science research** by leveraging structured formats and **LLM-powered experiment generation**.

---

## 🚀 What is TaskBeacon?  
TaskBeacon is an open science initiative that provides:  

✅ **Standardized Paradigm Format – TAPS**  
- We develop **TAPS (Task and Paradigm Structure)**, a **structured, reproducible format** for psychological paradigms.  
- Ensures **clarity, consistency, and high reproducibility** in experimental designs.  

✅ **LLM-Powered Experiment Generation**  
- Using **large language models (LLMs)** to **automate and streamline paradigm creation**.  
- Reduces experiment setup time while ensuring high-quality reproducible designs.  

✅ **Open-Source Psychological Task Library**  
- A **repository of well-documented experiment templates**, including:
  - 💻 Cognitive Tasks (e.g., Go/No-Go, Stroop, N-Back)  
  - 🏃 Reaction-Time Studies
  - 🧠 EEG/fMRI/EyeTracking/fNIR Studies
  - 🏥 Clinical and Behavioral Experiments  

✅ **Cross-Cultural Adaptation of Psychological Tasks**  
- Supporting **automatic localization** of paradigms into multiple languages.  
- Enhancing **global research collaboration and accessibility**.
